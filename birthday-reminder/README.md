This is a small React project to put in practice the { useState } Hook useage.

An array of objects is stored in data.js, it is possible to add more people (and birthdays) in that file.

To display this project, please open the terminal and run 'npm install && npm start' or manually install the node_modules folder from an existing create-react-app project.

Hope you enjoy it!
