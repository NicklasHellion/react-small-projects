This is a small React project to put in practice the { useEffect } Hook useage.

To display this project, please open the terminal and run 'npm install && npm start' or manually install the node_modules folder from an existing create-react-app project.

For this project, please also install react icons (npm install react icons --save).

Hope you enjoy it!
