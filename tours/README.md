This is a small React project to put in practice the { useEffect } Hook useage.

Data is fetched from an external API (https://course-api.com/react-tours-project).

To display this project, please open the terminal and run 'npm install && npm start' or manually install the node_modules folder from an existing create-react-app project.

Hope you enjoy it!
